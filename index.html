                          <p>
                              Cats are far more similar to their wild ancestors than dogs are to wolves, so dogs are 
                              in that sense the more domesticated of the two species. As they adapted to living alongside 
                              humans, cats became more sociable with one another and much more accepting of people, but there 
                              is no evidence that they have changed much more than that over the past few thousand years.

                            Will cats, which require meat, eventually <span class="font-borel text-color4">evolve</span> to eat a broader array of foods as dogs do?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Cats and dogs belong to a group of mammals known as Carnivora, and the wild ancestors of both species 
                            dined primarily on meat. Recent DNA analyses indicate that over the course of their evolution, dogs 
                            have acquired more copies of the so-called amylase gene, which makes an enzyme that helps to break 
                            down starch. Having more copies of this gene has allowed dogs to eat a more omnivorous diet. 
                            In contrast, the cat family, known as Felidae, lost the genes that encode several key enzymes—including 
                            those that manufacture vitamin A, prostaglandins and the amino acid taurine—early in its evolution. 
                            Whereas dogs (and humans) can synthesize these substances from plant-based precursors, cats have to obtain 
                            them from meat. To expand their diet, cats would have to evolve physiological traits that allow them to 
                            synthesize these and other key nutrients from plant foods. This capacity has not emerged during the 10 
                            million years of felid evolution, so it seems unlikely to arise spontaneously in our domestic cats.

                            Why do cats <span class="font-borel text-color4">purr</span>?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Cats purr because they have something to say, which roughly translated is “please keep still and pay 
                            attention to me.” Kittens purr to persuade their mothers to keep on nursing them, and pet cats purr 
                            when they want to be stroked. The vibrations emanating from the purr certainly have a calming effect 
                            on people. Yet sick cats will also purr as a cry for help. So purring doesn’t always mean “I’m happy.” 
                            Some researchers have claimed that the vibrations from purring might help heal bone damage in an injured cat.

                          1. Huskies were developed as <span class="font-borel text-color3">working sled dogs</span> over thousands of years by the Chukchi people living in 
                          the <span class="font-borel text-color3">Siberian peninsula</span> of northeast Asia

                          The area is home to one of the most hostile and extreme climates in the world—where winds can reach 
                            100 miles per hour and temperatures can drop to 100 degrees below zero. With teams of up to 20 dogs 
                            pulling their sleds out onto the ice in their search for food, the Chukchi relied on the dogs for 
                            survival, and the dogs were central to the people’s life and culture.

                      <p>
                        According to K-9 History, search planes and sleds worked together to rescue the crews of downed planes. 
                        A recon plane would locate the wreck and determine the safest route to get dogs sleds and rescue workers to the site. 
                        They’d transport them as close as possible to the site and then the dog sled teams would rescue injured flyers and 
                        retrieve cargo.

                        4. The breed gained fame in 1925 after Siberian Husky sled dogs heroically brought <span class="font-borel text-color3">lifesaving serum</span> to fight a diphtheria 
                        epidemic in Nome, Alaska
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        The closest source of the medicine was more than 600 miles away, so a dog-team relay involving 20 “mushers” 
                        (sled-team drivers) and more than 100 dogs was formed to bring the serum as quickly as possible.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Musher Leonhard Seppala left Nome with 20 Siberians, heading east to meet a team coming from the other 
                        direction carrying the package of medicine. Seppala’s team had to go farther than expected, but after 
                        traveling 170 miles in three days they finally met the other team.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With the medicine on board, Seppala turned his tired team around, with lead dog Togo at the front, 
                        and they began back toward Nome amid gale-force winds and temperatures of 30 degrees below zero. As they 
                        attempted to cross the frozen Norton Sound, darkness and blizzard conditions prevented Seppala from seeing 
                        the route ahead, but Togo navigated the team to a roadhouse on the shore, probably saving the lives of 
                        all—and preventing loss of the precious serum. The last leg of the relay was completed by Gunnar Kaasen 
                        and his team, led by Balto.

                        In 1926 Seppala was invited to tour the U.S. and visited cities across the country, with more than 40 
                        Siberian Huskies, including Togo. In New York City, the explorer Roald Amundsen presented Togo with a 
                        medal for his role in the serum relay. Although Togo and the rest of Seppala’s team ran the longest and 
                        most hazardous leg, due to being the leader of the final team Balto became the most famous dog of the 
                        run, and his statue now stands in Central Park.

                            In the perennial battle over dogs and cats, there’s a clear public relations winner.

                            Dogs are man’s best friend. They’re sociable, faithful and obedient. Our relationship with cats, 
                            on the other hand, is often described as more transactional. Aloof, mysterious and independent, 
                            cats are with us only because we feed them.
                          </p>

                          Or maybe not. On Monday, researchers reported that cats are just as strongly bonded to us as dogs 
                          or infants, vindicating cat lovers across the land.

                          I get that a lot — ‘Well, I knew that, I know that cats like to interact with me,’” said Kristyn 
                          Vitale, an animal behavior scientist at Oregon State University and lead author of the new study, 
                          published in Current Biology. “But in science, you don’t know that until you test it.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Research into cat behavior has lagged that into dogs. Cats are not social animals, many scientists 
                          assumed — and not as easy to work with. But recent studies have begun to plumb the depth of cats’ 
                          social lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In a study in 2017, Dr. Vitale and her colleagues found that the majority of cats prefer interacting 
                          with a person over eating or playing with a toy. In a 2019 study, the researchers found that cats 
                          adjust their behavior according to how much attention a person gives them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Other researchers have found that cats are sensitive to human emotion and mood, and that cats know their names.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Scientists had arrived at conflicting findings about whether cats form attachments to their owners, 
                          however, so Dr. Vitale and her colleagues designed a study to more explicitly test the hypothesis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          They recruited owners of 79 kittens and 38 adult cats to participate in a “secure base test,” 
                          an experiment commonly used to measure bonds that dogs and primates form with caretakers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the experiment, which lasted six minutes, cat and kitten owners entered an unfamiliar room with 
                          their animals. After two minutes, the owner left the room, leaving the cat or kitten alone — a 
                          potentially stressful experience for the animal. When the owner returned two minutes later, the 
                          researchers observed the feline’s response.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          About two-thirds of cats and kittens came to greet their owners when they returned, and then went 
                          back to exploring the room, periodically returning to their owners. These animals, the researchers 
                          concluded, were securely attached to their owners, meaning they viewed them as a safe base in an 
                          unfamiliar situation.

                          This may be an adaptation of the bond they would have with their parents when they were young,” Dr. 
                          Vitale said. This behavior, she added, may mean: “Everything’s O.K. My owner’s back, 
                          I feel comforted and reassured, and now I can go back to exploring.”

                          Many good dog owners get very passionate about the subject of what foods they feed their dogs. The 
                          husky raw diet therefore can be a perfect choice.

                          A good sound diet can contribute to the longevity and good health of our pets. The problem is that 
                          there is so much conflicting information about these diets. It confuses owners and makes them afraid 
                          to switch their dogs from a kibble diet to a raw diet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The truth is that there is no such thing as the perfect husky diet. They all have their benefits as 
                          well as their limitations. All we can do as good dog owners is to become very informed and take our 
                          cues from our dogs.

                      <p>
                        The husky raw diet has grown in popularity in the last decade, fueled mainly by the endless food 
                        recalls from the manufacturers of kibble-based food. Dog owners like to be in control over the quality 
                        and the safety of what their dogs will be ingesting.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There are two major types of raw diets, commercial and home prepared. Commercial raw diets can be either 
                        in fresh or frozen form, only ground meat, or ground meat with bone and offal. They can also include 
                        fresh fruits and veggies ground into the mixture too. Commercial raw food manufacturers pack raw meat 
                        into pucks.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The homemade raw diet consists of whole meat, bones, and offal. Optionally veggies, fruits, and 
                        supplements can be added. The only difference is that the mixture is not commercially ground; instead, 
                        it is fed more or less whole and left for the dog to chew. Starting from scratch gives you complete 
                        control over what goes into your dog’s diet. This is especially good if your dog is allergic to a certain 
                        protein source.

                          Meats are high in phosphorus. Bones are high in calcium. When the bone is fed at 10%, you have pretty

                          a balanced ratio.

                          Organ meats should not exceed 10% of the diet, and 5% should be liver. Feed the liver once a week and 
                          try to find an organic free-range fed source whenever possible.

                          Pork or Salmon should be frozen for two weeks before feeding to kill parasites in the meat.

                          Feed trachea, trim, and poultry feet as they are an excellent natural source of chondroitin and 
                          glucosamine that help build and support healthy joints in your dog.

                          Always feed only raw bones as cooked bones will splinter and pierce the stomach or the intestines.

                          Always be safe and supervise all bone-chewing activities if you have to intervene.

                        If you are feeding a dog over 6 months, split it into 2 feedings per day.
                        The raw diet for husky puppies 4 to 6 months old should be split into 3 meals per day.
                        Feeding a puppy under 4 months old, split into 4 or more meals per day.
